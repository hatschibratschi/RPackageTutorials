## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
r = 2^3
print(r)
```

### Inline-code

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Inline code: `r paste(r)`. There are `r nrow(iris)` observations in our iris data.
